## Where Do I Start? (Entry Point Guide)

| Your Situation | Command | What Happens |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **I have just an idea** | `/new-project "your idea"` | 8-phase pipeline: brainstorm → spec → features → domain → tech → architecture → scaffold → deploy plan |
| **I have existing PRDs/specs** | `/import-docs "path/"` then `/new-project --resume` | Imports docs, skips covered phases, continues from first gap |
| **I have an existing codebase** | `/scan-codebase` → `/generate-environment` → `/validate-setup` | Scans tech stack, generates full Claude Code environment |
| **I want to build one feature** | `/workflow new "feature description"` | 13-phase SDLC with requirements → dev → test → review → deploy |
| **I have a production bug** | `/hotfix "critical issue"` | Fast-track: fix → test → deploy in minutes, skip design/business phases |
| **I have a small bug** | `/fix-bug "description"` | 5-step: reproduce → diagnose → fix → test → review (< 50 lines, < 3 files) |
| **I'm joining this project** | `/onboard` | Generates guide: architecture, conventions, setup, active work, how to contribute |
| **I came back after a break** | Just start a session | Session-start hook shows active tasks, progress, what to resume |
| **I want full automation** | `/idea-to-launch "idea"` | Idea → pre-dev → build all features → deploy → monitor |
| **Something looks stale** | `/sync --check` | Detects drift between environment and codebase, auto-fixes with `--fix` |
